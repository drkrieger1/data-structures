#String Reversal 
The code starts in main method, in my main method i create a string variable that holds "hellos" the string that will reversed.
Line 10: will display our result to the console, by calling on the reverse method and passing in my startString of "hellos".
Line 11: will keep the the console window from closing when the task is complete.

Line 13: This is where i make my revers method that takes in a string argument of myInput.
Line 15: declare a string variable called out put and set it to empty with "".
Line 16: Makes a for loop to iterate through our startString and reprint it backwards. This is dont by setting variable or i to an int the length of 
argument minus 1, then i decroments.
Line 18: myInput at index i will plus equale to the output variable. 
Line 20: returns the reversed string and that returned string is then printed in the console by line 10. 

#Linked Lists 
This thing was really hard, there is alot of solutions on google but they do not have a very good explination for the logic.
I used a tutorial from codeprojects.com. 
made a nod class and a linkedlist class.
The linkedlist class held all of your logic.
