#linked list 

#Approach
We start by creating a node class and linked list class, for the node class we set a propertieds of "next" to null, this acts as a pointer, and a "data" property to store data that will be passed in when the node id instanciated. In the linked list class we make a head and set it to a new instence of a node and assige the head to a current variable. The linked list class holds our methods that will be doing all of the logic.
